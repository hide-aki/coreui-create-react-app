# coreui reactjs + create-react-app

This is just a boilerplate/sample,
how to integrate `coreui` in `create-react-app`.

**note**, that sass can't be compiled in `create-react-app` by default. So here i implement with `node-sass-chokidar`

mostly its just make compilation for sass to css, in `src/styles/css`, and react include css files, instead of sass
